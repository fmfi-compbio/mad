  - During the course, you will have to edit scripts, protocols and
    other files.
  - Our server has several editors installed.
  - If you can use graphical interface, we recommend `kate`, which is
    used similarly as Windows-based editors.
  - If you need to work in a text-only mode (slow connection or no X
    support):
      - As a simple editor you can use [nano](https://nano-editor.org/)
        (see keyboard shortcuts at the bottom of the screen).
      - More advanced editors include [vim](https://www.vim.org/),
        [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
        [ne](https://ne.di.unimi.it/) (read tutorials before starting
        using them).
  - When working from Windows, you can also connect to the server via
    WinScp and edit the files using WinScp built-in editors or other
    editors installed on your computer (see
    [Connecting\_to\_server](./Connecting_to_server.md)).
  - When working from Linux, you can mount your home directory using
    sshfs and again use editors installed on your computer (see
    [Connecting\_to\_server](./Connecting_to_server.md)).
