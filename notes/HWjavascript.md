**General goal:** Extend the user pages from the previous lecture with
simple visualizations.

Submit your source code to `/submit/javascript/username/`. Also do not
forget to submit the database (even if it is the database from us).

This lesson requires a database with crawled data and a webserver from
previous lessons. If you don't have one, you can find it at
`/tasks/javascript`
