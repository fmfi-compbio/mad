Grades:

  - A: 90 and more, B: 80...89, C: 70...79, D: 60...69, E: 50...59, FX:
    less than 50%

You will get Fx if your oral exam is not satisfactory, even if you have
sufficient points from other activities.

## Course format

  - Every Thursday three-hour class, we start with a short lecture. Then
    you start solving assigned tasks, which you complete as a homework
    assignment.
  - We highly recommend doing the homework during class, as we can help
    you as needed. We really encourage you to ask questions during this
    time. At other times, ask your questions via email, but you may have
    to wait longer for the answer.
  - If you **attend** the whole 3-hour class, you are allowed to work on
    the homework in a **pair** with one of your classmates. You can then
    also finish the homework together after the class and submit just
    one homework listing both your names.
      - During work, occasionally exchange roles (driver who is typing
        the program or commands and navigator who is advising the
        driver). Both students should completely understand all parts of
        the submitted homework.
      - If you do not attend the class (or only a part of it), you have
        to do the homework individually.
  - Some weeks will have a separate material for Bioinformatics program
    and separately for others. If you would like to do a homework other
    than the one intended for you, you must obtain a prior consent of
    the instructors.
  - You will submit a project during the exam period. Afterwards there
    will be an oral exam concentrating on the project and submitted
    homework.
  - You will have an account on a Linux server dedicated to this course.
    Use this account only for the purposes of this course and try not to
    overload the server so that it serves all students. Any attempts to
    disrupt the operation of the server will be considered a serious
    violation of the course rules.

## Homework

  - The deadline for each homework is 9:00 of the day of the next
    lecture, i.e. usually almost one week from when the homework was
    published.
  - You can work on your homework on any computer, preferably under
    Linux. However, the submitted code or commands should be executable
    on the course server, so do not use special software or settings on
    your computer.
  - The homework is submitted by copying the required files to the
    required directory on the server. Details will be specified in the
    assignment.
  - Follow any filenames specified in the assignment and use reasonable
    filenames for additional files.
  - Make sure the submitted source code is easy to read (indentation,
    reasonable variable names, comments as needed)

### Protocols

  - Usually, a document called a protocol will be a required part of the
    homework.
  - Write the protocol in txt format and name the file **protocol.txt**
    (copy it to the upload directory)
  - The protocol can be in Slovak or English.
  - If you write with diacritics, use UTF8 encoding, but feel free to
    omit diacritics in protocols.
  - In most homeworks, you get a protocol outline, follow it and do not
    change our headings.

**Self-assessment**

  - At the top of the protocol, fill in the names of the authors of the
    homework. This is very important if you work in a pair.
  - Below fill in a self-assessment which for every task should contain
    one of the following codes.
      - Use code DONE if you think the task is completely and correctly
        solved.
      - Use code PART if you have completed only a part of the task.
        After the code briefly state, which part was completed and
        potentially if you had problem with something.
      - Use code UNSURE, if you have completed the task but are not sure
        about something. Again briefly explain what are you unsure of.
      - Use code NOTHING, if you have not even started to do the task.
  - Your self-assessment will guide us in grading. Tasks marked as DONE
    will be checked briefly, but we will try to give you feedback to
    tasks marked UNSURE or PART, particularly if you note down what was
    causing you problems.
  - Try to fill in self-assessment the best you can. It can influence
    your grade.

**Protocol contents**

  - Unless specified otherwise, the protocol should contain the
    following information:
      - **List of submitted files:** usually already filled in, add any
        other files you submit with a brief explanation of their
        meaning.
      - **The sequence of commands used,** or other steps you took to
        get the results. Include commands to process data and run your
        or other programs. It is not necessary to specify commands
        related to the programming itself (starting the editor, setting
        file permissions), copying the files to the server, etc. For
        more complex commands, also provide brief **comments**
        explaining the purpose of a particular command or group of
        commands. If you use some non-standard libraries, state how to
        install them.
      - **Observations** the results required by the tasks and any
        discussion of these results.
      - **Resources:** websites and other sources that you used to solve
        the task. You do not have to list the course website and
        resources recommended directly in the assignment.

Overall, the protocol should allow the reader to understand your files
and also, in case of interest, to perform the same calculations as you
used to obtain the result. You do not have write to a formal text, only
clear and brief notes.

## Project

The aim of the project is to extend your skills on a data processing
project. Your task is to obtain data, analyze this data with some
techniques from the lectures and display the results in graphs and
tables.

  - In about two thirds of the semester, you will submit a short project
    proposal
  - A deadline for submitting the project (including the written report)
    will be during the exam period
  - You can also do projects in pairs, but then we require a larger
    project and each member should be primarily responsible for a
    certain part of the project

More detailed information on projects is on [ a separate
page](./Project.md).

## Oral exam

  - During the oral exam, we will give you our feedback to your project
    and ask related questions.
  - We can also ask you about some of the homeworks you have submitted
    during the semester.
  - You should be able to explain your code and do small modifications
    in it.

Details:

  - Before the exam we will publish preliminary time schedule.
  - Please come to the computer room where the exam takes place at the
    indicated time, start one of the computers and open your project in
    a form in which you can modify it. You may also use your computer if
    you prefer.
  - One of us will talk with you and assign you a small task related to
    your project or homeworks.
  - You will have time to work on this task. You may use course website
    and internet resources, such as documentation and existing
    discussions. You may not communicate with other people or use AI
    tools during the oral exam.
  - Please leave any resources you used open in the browser.

## Academic integrity

  - You are allowed to talk to classmates and other people about
    homework and projects and general strategies to solve them. However,
    the code, the results obtained, and the text you submit must be
    **your own work**. It is forbidden to show your code or texts to the
    classmates.

<!-- end list -->

  - When working on the homework and the project, we expect you to use
    Internet resources, especially various manuals and discussion forums
    on the used technologies. However, do not try to find ready-made
    solutions to the given tasks. List all resources used in a homework
    or a project.

<!-- end list -->

  - Do not use AI chatbots or AI code generation in your editor (such as
    Github copilot and similar) for solving homeworks (you do not learn
    anything that way\!). Some use of AI code generation is permitted on
    the final projects, see [project rules](./Project.md).

<!-- end list -->

  - If we find cases of plagiarism or unauthorized aids, all
    participating students will receive zero points for the relevant
    homework or project (including the students who provided their
    solutions to others to copy). Violations of academic integrity will
    be also referred to the faculty disciplinary committee.

## Sharing materials

Assignments and materials for the course are freely available on this
webpage. However, do not publish or otherwise share your homework
solutions as they closely follow the outline given by us. You can
publish your projects if you wish, as long as it does not conflict with
your agreement with the provider of your data.
